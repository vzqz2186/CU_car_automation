# CU Image Recognition Neural Network
Senior capstone project for Cumberland University. The purpose for this project was to create a simple convolutional neural network for image recognition in order to give a simple example of what automated cars do in order to detect obstacles on the road. The project utilized the TensorFlow platform and Keras libraries.

jvazquez_nncode_v3.02.2.py creates the neural network model and trains it using the CIFAR-10 tiny image data set. It achieves about 84% accuracy identifying objects in images correctly.

jvazquez_trainednn_v2.00.py tests the trained model created in the other program with sample images that do not belong to the CIFAR-10 data set. Images were obtained from pexels.com, a free stock photos website.

The images included in this project are the ones downloaded from pexels.com used to test the trained model.
